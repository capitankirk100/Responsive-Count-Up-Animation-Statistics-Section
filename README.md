I'll create a responsive statistics section with animated counters that match your design. This will be added to the "notifiche" section after "chat" as requested.

```typescriptreact project="stats_counter"

## How It Works

I've created a responsive statistics section with animated counters that match your design. Here's what it includes:

1. **Animated Counters**: Numbers count up from 0 to their final value with a smooth animation
2. **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
3. **Customizable Icons**: Using Lucide React icons that match your requirements
4. **Theme Support**: Works with both light and dark themes
5. **Intersection Observer**: Animation only starts when the stats are visible on screen


### Features

- **Smooth Animation**: The counters use a quadratic easing function for a natural-looking animation
- **Responsive Grid**: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop
- **Customizable Colors**: Each stat can have its own accent color
- **Automatic "+" Symbol**: Automatically adds "+" for values that need it


### Integration

To use this in your existing project:

1. Add the `StatisticsSection` component to your notifiche page after the chat section
2. The component will automatically handle the animations when scrolled into view
3. You can customize the icons, colors, and values as needed


This implementation matches the design in your image while adding smooth animations and ensuring it works well on all device sizes.
